I'm a Java programmer and game developer. Just writing some articles about programming. I try to make them as helpful as possible on topics, that can cause confusion without an example.

You can contact me by email (on the bottom of this page). 

You can also message me on Telegram. My username is @IvanLudvig.

P.S. I seriously think there are too many occurrences of my name on this website. And I don't know what to do with it.
