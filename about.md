I'm a Java, Javascript, Python and C++ programmer, web and game developer. Just writing some articles about programming. I try to make them as helpful as possible on topics, that may cause confusion.

You can contact me by email (on the bottom of this page). 

You can also message me on Telegram. My handle is @IvanLudvig.

P.S. I seriously think there are too many occurrences of my name on this website. And I don't know what to do with it.
