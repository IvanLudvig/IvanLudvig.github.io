Pocket Sword is an app that plays a sword unsheathing sound when the user takes out the phone from his pocket. The sound is really iconic and lets you feel the glory of a warrior with a sword, but it can confuse or even scare strangers. It's really simple and can be used to impress your friends and have fun yourself.
The app can run in the background.
