I'm a big fan of islands, so I went to Cyprus for the holidays. Limassol is the second largest city in Cyprus by population. When I was there, the weather was mostly awful, but there was one sunny day.

I spent Catholic Christmas with other lost travellers from the hostel, just like last year. For the first time I met someone from Iowa. We cooked some presumably local dishes, although I don't cook well so I contributed with wine. It was relaxed and cosy with the candles. Later that night, after 1AM, a man appeared with a mysterious bottle labeled in Greek and started talking about Western Africa. Out of habit, I started searching for the alcohol content of the drink but could only find "100%". That's when I decided it was time to go to sleep. 

On Christmas Day we went swimming.

Not much to see in the city. There are a couple of beautiful churches.

Although Cyprus is culturally European, the streets have a Middle Eastern vibe. Maybe it's the yellowish buildings and poor city planning?

Paphos is like a big village. It reminds me of [Fethiye](/travel/?city=fethiye){:target="_blank"}.

The main city is on a hill. Down by the sea they have archeological parks and, well, the sea.

I visited the archaeological site of the Tombs of the Kings.

I came across an absurd map of how to reach different landmarks around Paphos by public transport. I especially like the boxes that say "SEA". Fortunately, I escaped that toil by making nice friends, with whom we explored the island by car.

According to Greek mythology, Aphrodite was born from the sea foam near this rock.
