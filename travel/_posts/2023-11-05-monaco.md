I went to Monaco from Nice by train (â‚¬4,40). The ticket machines in France have an unusual interface, which I couldn't figure out without asking another person for help. I think of myself as tech savvy, but that spinning button idea was unapparent and threw me off.

Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world. It didn't feel crowded at all, but the buildings and roads are dense and situated on different levels.

One may think that Monaco is just a city in France. But a few things indicated that it's a different country: the numerous flags and other national symbols, as well as the fact that my Italian SIM didn't have free roaming like in EU countries, because Monaco is not part of the EU.

Another peculiar thing are the license plates, which are much smaller than in other countries.

Monaco seemed to have few tourists and I wasn't sure where to go. Unlike other cities the streets didn't lead me to noteworthy squares or sites. I wasn't able to search online things to see in Monaco so I wandered.

Despite being the most densely populated country, construction keeps on going.

Soon enough I left Monaco and entered France. The length of Monaco is about 3.3km, so the whole country is walkable. But I wouldn't recommend going on walks here.
