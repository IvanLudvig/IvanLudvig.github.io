The second island I visited was Fuerteventura. It is not only more deserted than Lanzarote, it's also more deserty. I stayed in the North, in Corralejo, which is near a big desert. I loved that desert and went there every day.

Fuerteventura was windy. But that's kinda good because you don't feel boiling in the sun. And I love the desert. So vast, empty with no one around. Seems endless when you walk over a dune just to find another one. Awesome.

If you walk long enough in the desert, you may find yourself on beach. It's a really big beach with wind and waves. Lots of surfers and kitesurfers in this place.

I don't get surfing. From my observations, they spend most of the time looking for waves, then they "catch" one, wobble on the board for half a minute and fall down. Doesn't seem appealing to me. But maybe these were amateurs or the waves weren't good that day. Whereas kitesurfing seems fun.

If you walk along the coast to the East, you will find more deserted land, but not that deserty. Also, a beach with popcorn sand.

The capital of Fuerteventura is Puerto del Rosario. Came here on my way to the airport. The beach is pretty decent for a city.

The city is full of weird monuments and has a bottomless pit in the middle of the city (I want to speak to the supervisor).
