Cascais is a nice day trip from Lisbon by train.

It's a sea-side town.

When I'm walking the streets in Portugal and hear people talking, I think that they must be speaking Russian because the languages sound similar. But when I come closer, I realize that it's not Russian most of the time. But in Cascais a lot of people were actually speaking Russian.

The day I visited there was a storm. But we had a wall.

It's a great opportunity to take pictures.

Boca do Inferno (Hell's Mouth) is a scenic cave, where waves violently crash. Here you can feel the pulse of the ocean. In 1930 the occultist Aliester Crowley staged his suicide here just for the hype, reappearing 3 weeks later.

I loved observing the violent ocean.
