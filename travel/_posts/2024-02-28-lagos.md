Lagos is a resort town in the Algarve region of Portugal. I visited it out of season. It felt empty.

Although the water was cold, I still went for a swim.

The town feels off-beat.

Portugal has very nice grocery stores. It seems like the Portuguese like eating soup and fish.

After a two-day hike, it felt like I was at the end of a journey. The quiet, empty town and the cold ocean encouraged self-reflection. These 2 pictures capture the mood perfectly.

I spent 2 days in Lagos and went out on one of the nights with other travellers, who were almost all German. They can open beers with anything.

In the morning I didn't know where to go next. Having asked for some advice, I decided to go to Faro by train. I like the way the Portuguese railway looks.

The train stations have minimalistic signs.
