When was the last time you heard about North Macedonia? I recall only the naming dispute with Greece, which lead to the renaming of the country from Macedonia to North Macedonia. I think it's one of the quietest countries in Europe. Either they're boring, or they must be up to something.

Before arriving in Ohrid, I thought it would be a decaying Yugoslav-era resort town, forgotten by both God and Allah — two flavours of faith are common here. Well, not quite.

First of all, the flag! It's beautiful and used a lot.

The old flag with the Vergina Sun is also seen often, as well as the symbol separately, despite their agreement with Greece "to remove the Vergina Sun from all public spaces".

Another source of appreciation for national symbols is the money. The design of the North Macedonian Denar notes is pure art, featuring religious icons and animals with gorgeous colour combinations.

Now, let's explore. First, we walk the bridge along the cliff.

Then, we climb the said cliff. Next, turn around.

There are a couple of beautiful churches on this hill.

The hill is big and the rest is mostly nature with great views. It's possible to go down and swim. It's surprisingly quiet compared to how busy the town is.

A dreamy place.

Back to the city. It is not very remarkable.

The hostel where I was staying offered a boat trip and I wanted to go. But on both of the days I was there, there were apparently "waves". The lake seems very peaceful to me. I wonder what they'll think when they hear about the sea. Still, I'm not disappointed a bit.

The magical sunset.

The way light reflects on the water is what keeps me going in life.

This could also be a symbol of Macedonia. Consistency is maintained both visually and conceptually, since its function is similar to the Sun's: providing energy.
