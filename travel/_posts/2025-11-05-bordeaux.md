I loved Bordeaux for being Gothic.

A tram line passes between us and the fabulous Porte Cailhau in the first picture. Notice how there are no overhead wires. Indeed, the power supply is kept underground so we can enjoy clean Gothic views. The trams have round noses, which make them seem friendly and harmless, and that's what they actually are.

The tram diagram mimics the rounded style of the trams themselves and is beautifully designed, like most things in France. I noticed there's a route in the river and since it's on the tram map, I am assuming it's called a water tram. Of course, I tried it: great experience.

I associate white buildings with the South and grey with the North. Bordeaux is a mix. Maybe the vibe depends on the weather. Today is cloudy.

Many streets in the city centre are nicely designed without curbs.

Some art is familiar, some is a literal stretch.
