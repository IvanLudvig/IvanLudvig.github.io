Seville is the capital of Andalusia.

The Seville cathedral is huge. In fact, it's the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. Yet I don't have a clear idea what it looks like as a whole, or even where the main entrance is. There's no big open square around it, so it's not possible to step back and see it from a distance. For me it's a collection of spires, stacked arches, sharp edges like thorns, sculptures on ledges and round windows framed in intricate patterns.

The tower and the cathedral are remarkably similar to what I saw in [Valencia](/travel/2025/valencia#cathedral), but bigger.

The old city is a maze of narrow streets. Very easy to walk in circles, which I did during the day and night.

The design of police cars looks like it's inspired by toy cars.

The metro of Seville has just one line. I didn't use it.

There is also just one tram line. It's a short route with just 8 stations, covering 3.5km in the city centre. The trams don't require overhead wires for energy. Except for stations, where the trams are rapidly charged.

The Alcazar is a big palace, mixing Moorish and Christian elements.

I enjoyed the patterns.

There is also a lovely garden outside.

NODO is the moto of Seville. It stands for "no me ha dejado". I provide no context, but a translation: "she didn't leave me". It is seen on many details of the city.

Just like that, it's already night. What a day! In fact, it was three days.

The train station is one of the ugliest I've seen.

We have Uzbekistan at home: here's islamic architecture, here's plov (but called paella) and here's a high-speed train.
