Belgrade is considered one of the most destroyed and rebuilt cities in the world, so it's hard to get a visually clear overview of the city's history. It doesn't feel neither new, nor old. Maybe "second-hand" is a good way to describe it.

As I understand, it all started with the dinosaurs.

After the dinosaurs, just behind them, stands a fortress. Not much is known apart from this reference point. The other oldest buildings date only from the 19th century.

New Belgrade is on the other side of the river, reachable by tram.

The idea of adding the "New" prefix when building the city appears to be a recent, brave move. I'm assuming the people behind it were sure that Belgrade is not going to be rebuilt ever again. Otherwise, having an old "New" Belgrade would've been ironic. The final version of the city must have been built in the best possible way: to last, to live and to thrive as the White City.
