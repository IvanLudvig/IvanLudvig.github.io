I went to Nice by bus from Turin. The journey takes 4 hours and cost me €15. I went there for the weekend and Saturday turned out to be a raint day. Still I was happy to see the sea.

In the Côte d'Azur only the coast is Azure. The rest of the sea is a darker shade of blue.

The architecture of Nice is rather Italian, but the city is cleaner, more polished and posh than most Italian cities.

There are 7 statues on the main square, symbolizing 7 continents. The installation is called "conversation in Nice". At night, when the city calms down and the last tram leaves, you can hear them exchanging whispers. What do they talk about? Naturally, they talk about the sea.
> In heaven that's all they talk about — the ocean — and how wonderful it is. They talk about the sunsets they have seen. They talk about how the sun turned blood-red before it set. And they talk about how they felt when the sun was loosing its power, — and the cold that was coming from the ocean, while the rest of the fire was still glowing.
