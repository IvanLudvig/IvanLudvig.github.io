I went to Syracuse by train from Catania for a day trip. Like in most of Southern Italy, the trains are infrequent.

The historical center of Syracuse is located on the Ortigia island.

There's a backstory in Greek mythology to a freshwater spring on the island: it's said that the nymph [Arethusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arethusa_(mythology)) escaped Arcadia beneath the sea and resurfaced as a fountain on Oritigia. Interestingly, you can see papyrus growing there. It's one of the rare spots in Europe where the plant is found (the other locations are also in Sicily).

Walking along the coast I saw a nice spot for a swim. The weather in December was fine as well.

The sea didn't seem too rough when looking at it, but I swam near the rocks (not the best choice) and the waves tossed me around like a fish. I lost my watch, yet surprisingly managed to find it. I ended up with lots and lots of scratches all over my body. Interestingly, I didn't notice until my travel-friends pointed out that my back was bleeding. Ultimately, this experience was part of me reconciling with the environment. I loved it because it made me feel more alive.

In the evening I went to the Neapolis archeological park full of various artefacts.

I especially liked the caves.

The Ear of Dionysius is a big cave with exceptional acoustics: everything you say is amplified. It is still a question whether the cave is manmade or artificial.

In the distance you can see a peculiar cone-like structure: it's a Basilica.

I enjoyed the day trip to Syracuse. It's much nicer than Catania.
