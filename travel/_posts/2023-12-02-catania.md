I visited Sicily for 3 days by flying to Catania from Turin for €25 round-trip.

I spent the first day in Catania, the second day in Syracuse and the third on Etna. Catania was grey, gloomy and grim. The city sits at the foot of Mount Etna, Europe's largest and most active volcano.

There's a statue of an elephant on the main square, which is one of the symbols of Catania. Of course, this raises the question why is it an elephant given that they don't live here. The monument itself was made from lava stone in the 1730s, but the elephant known as "u Liotru" was a symbol of Catania long before that. There's a [myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_Fountain#U_Liotru) how it originated, involving the necromancer Heliodorus, who lived in Catania in the 8-th century. He had carved the elephant from the lava of Etna and used to ride it from Catania to Constaninople. In the end he was burned alive. Most importantly, the elephant looks happy anyway.

Lava stone is prevalent as a building material, which gives the city its grey color.

I love the flag of Sicily. It shows the Medusa head in the center and the triskeles three-legged symbol, which is remarkably also found on the Manx flag. This symbol of Sicily is ancient, dating back to 700 BC. It is said to represent the three capes of the island, which has the shape of a triangle.

It looks like the city is covered in soot. Perhaps the oldest buildings were actually made from the grey volcanic stone and the rest of the city decided to follow regardless of material. Catania retains its volcanic nature.

In the evening I went to the beach, passing by the port and some rough semi-abandonded parts of the city, dodging the wild traffic. Looking back, most of the city is like that.

I would like to thank the ketchup in my sandwich and the graffiti on the train for adding some colour.
