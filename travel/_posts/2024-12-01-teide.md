What do unemployed people do? They climb volcanoes. Teide was one of my goals for this trip. I've previously been to an active volcano [Etna](/travel/2023/etna){:target="_blank"} in Sicily and it was incredible. 

The national park is poorly connected by public transport, but I found like-minded travelers at my hostel, who had a car. We made great friends. The main trail to the Teide's peak was closed, so we climbed to Pico Viejo instead, which is the second highest peak on the island. The hike is 16km both ways with a total elevation gain of ~1100m. It took us 6 hours.

This is the highest point we've reached: Pico Viejo at 3129m. It is cold and very windy up there. I think it's the highest point I've ever been to.

On the way back we took another path around the rock formations.

After the amazing yet incredibly exhausting hike, we enjoyed the underwhelming sunset before coming back down to town and having paella and beer.
