In Greek Cyprus, the divide of the island is presented in a weird way, almost denying that there is another country on the island. The border is called "the green line", the border crossing is a "police checkpoint" and so on. But as a matter of fact, no matter how you view the situation, Northern Cyprus is a different country with a different language, currency, flag etc. Wikipedia says it's a "de facto state", recognised only by Turkey.

Northern Cyprus uses the Turkish Lira. Although currency exchanges clearly display exchange rates, you still have to count the money and haggle to get the right rate.

The Christmas decorations are the same as in the [Greek half of Nicosia](/travel/2024/nicosia#christmas-decorations), but the Greek ones are _sleeker_.

Büyük Han is the largest [caravanserai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravanserai){:target="_blank"} (new funny word for me) on Cyprus.

The city centre is small. Overall, the city feels small and semi-abandoned.

Towns in Northern Cyprus are known by two names: a Turkish (Girne) and a Greek name (Kyrenia). You would guess that only the Turkish name is used in Northern Cyprus, but the bus driver was shouting both versions. The bus stop for Girne is just outside the Venetian walls obviously by the Kyrenia Gate. A ticket costs 100 TL (€2.70).

The Flag of Northern Cyprus looks stylish. I like it.

Kyrenia has a lovely castle built by the Venetians.

Many ancient artifacts are carelessly left lying around.

Apart from the castle, nothing else to see in Girne. Maybe we should've gone to Gazimagusa/Famagusta instead.

### North Nicosia
Back to Nicosia. By the way, the city is known as Lefkoşa in Northern Cyprus and as Lefkosia in Greek Cyprus. Nicosia is the international name.

At night most of the streets, even in the city centre, are dark.

Since [Turkey](/travel?country=tr){:target="_blank"} struggles with high inflation, the prices are high in Northern Cyprus too. It is cheaper to eat in Greek Cyprus and the food is better there too. In fact, everything is better in Greek Cyprus. So we went back.
