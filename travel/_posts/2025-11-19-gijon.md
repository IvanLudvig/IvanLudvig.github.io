Gijón is a coastal city just 30km from the capital of Asturias, Oviedo. They are of comparable sizes and I chose to stay in Gijón because I prefer the sea. The city sits against green hills and snowy mountains further away, those are part of Picos de Europa.

My BlaBlaCar driver wondered why I'd come here and said the city is industrial and not nice. At least I was reassured about my Spanish skills because our long conversation was in Spanish.

Indeed, I found Gijón quite unremarkable at first glance. The city feels provincial.

The bus station has a slick old sign. Unfortunately, it lacks any other relevant signs.

A piece of street art with overlapping faces on a weathered wall touched me. I associate it with something deeply human: the quiet desperation of realizing the fragility of life.

Windows facing the ocean form an ocean of their own, that flows from building to building.

The ocean is fantastic and the city has a nice long beach. Even surfers come here, or at least one did when I was there.

It's possible to walk far along the coast. Different monuments and sculptures, often modern, are placed along it.

Such as Elogio del Horizonte. When I first encountered a similar coastal sculpture in Donostia, Comb of the Wind, I didn't understand it. The concrete and rust, evoking a feeling of burden -- why is it there? Gijón was the last city on my Northern Spain trip and I finally got it.

My head spun from it.
