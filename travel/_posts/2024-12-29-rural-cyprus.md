After visiting [Aphrodite's Rock](/travel/2024/limassol#Aphrodites-Rock){:target="_blank"}, we went to Omodos. It's a small village in the Troodos mountains.

Greek villages are white.

We had a meal and tasted some local wine.

On another day, we started the day with visiting three lakes, which appeared after mining activities. The Memi Mine Lake is supposed to be bright blue and beautiful. But on a rainy day it was dark green. The other two lakes were also dull.

In the middle of Cyprus, there is a proper Russian Orthodox church with gilded domes. It's unusual to see something so familiar here.

The murals on the walls inside the church are done in an overly colourful realistic style. I find it kitschy. Churches in Russia are different.

The church is part of a whole complex, sponsored by a Russian businessman.

I liked the mosaics of saints, placed in a little park with a playground.

Then, there's a planetarium. Thematic decorations, such as inflatable planets and spaceships, are placed right in front of the church. Is this an attempt to show Russian culture in Cyprus?

An explanatory comment:
> “With the Planetarium, we are decoding the wisdom of God through the greatness of the universe. The study of space and stars expands the horizons of man. The Planetarium is a great contribution to education and culture,” stated the Metropolitan of Tamasos and Oreinis.

A wooden spire peaks from behind the souvenir shop.

It is a small Romanian Orthodox church, built in a traditional wooden style. Charming and graceful.

Next, we visited the Monastery of Archangel Michael. No photos allowed inside.

Finally, we went to Pano Lefkara, a village known for its jewelry and [lace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefkara_lace){:target="_blank"}. It had a Christmas market, which wasn't a pleasant experience given the rain.

Foreigners think this is English and Greek. At first glance, I also thought so.

After dark it's more cheerful with the Christmas lights.
