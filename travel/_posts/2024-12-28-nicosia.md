Go ahead and take a look at the map. I zoomed it in so you can see the shape of the city and the border in the middle. The old city is a fortress surrounded by walls, like [Valletta](/travel?city=valletta){:target="_blank"}, but not that massive. The Venetian walls were completed in the 16th century and are still there, but now the city is much bigger, expanding beyond them.

The main square is called Eleftheria (Liberty) Square. It is located next to the Venetian walls, right below them.

Next to another part of the wall, there's a bus station.

And there are all sorts of landmarks in the old city.

The streets are narrow.

Looks lovely, but there are very few people.

Some parts of the city look abandoned, especially closer to the border.

The border looks like a makeshift, as if it was made out whatever was available at hand, never intended to last. People still believe it's temporary, although it's been there for over 50 years.

Street art is appropriately sad.

Outside of old Nicosia, the city is unremarkable. The most remarkable thing was a very good bakery close to the hostel where I stayed. In fact, it wasn't an ordinary bakery: it had all sorts of food. I loved it.

Back to the city center, it's possible to cross the border at the end of the main pedestrian street: Ledra Street.

It's forbidden to take photos of the border, but I took a picture of this marvelous monument and caught the checkpoint in the right hand side.
