Arriving at the train station, I saw an intriguing painting depicting the city.

The artist has no illusions about how Uzice looks and doesn't try to portray it in a better light. It's surprisingly accurate: grey buildings, green hills with smaller red-roofed houses and the railway.

This is the view from the hill with the castle. In the painting it's on the left.

The artist included the railway, but not the river that beautifully flows through the city, almost aligning with the railway. Similarly, the brutalist building is depicted in detail, while the castle is barely distinguishable. Is the painting what the city wants to be, or just what it is? Do the locals dream of concrete and steel?

The brutalist building is a major reference point of the city, like a nail.

The rest of the streets are grey and lead to grey places.

Such as a typical local pljeskavica place. Notice the donation box for "the people and the holy sites in Kosovo and Metohija". The place has a vibe like it should be visited after midnight, preferably drunk.

Gladly, I have already practiced my Serbian and pljeskavica ordering skills in Belgrade, which include knowing the names of vegetables and sauces.

I hope I don't dream of concrete and steel.
