I arrived at the small Jerez airport on a flight from [Mallorca](/travel/2025/mallorca) (€10). Many passengers were carrying round boxes with them: those are ensaimadas, a traditional Mallorcan pastry.

Cadiz is an interesting place: it's situated on a peninsula in the Atlantic Ocean. It's the oldest city in Spain, founded by the Phoenicians in 1100 BC. When I learned Spanish at university, my teacher often spoke about Cadiz, his favourite city in Spain. He always said "when you visit Cadiz...", not "if", as if it was just a matter of time and everyone in the room would once find themselves there. Well, this hypothetical moment has finally arrived for me.

The old city has character. I like the religious tiles.

Zooming out and lowering our gaze to see other parts.

The old city is dense with buildings.

Finally, a park. It has very big and wide trees, providing much needed shade in, as I imagine, most of the year. In February, when I visited, it was around 20C.

A long bridge leads to a castle, which is almost 1km away from the city. Let's walk there at night?

Now, let's walk along the coast towards the beach.

Interesting structure by the beach. No idea what it is.

The beach is very long. Is the beach on the edge of the city any better? Why did you take me here?

Gazing at the opposite direction from the ocean, you see a tall structure. The city is connected to the mainland's power grid by 158 metre tall pylons, which design was influenced by the shortage of steel in the 1950s. They resemble the hyperboloid [Shukhov towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shukhov_Tower){:target="_blank"} in Russia, although they are not hyperboloid.

The sun sets everywhere on Earth. Wait, it doesn't, nevermind.

I wanted to say that everywhere on Earth is similar. Although I'm in this place for the first time, the wind and the sea are familiar to me and make the place less foreign.
