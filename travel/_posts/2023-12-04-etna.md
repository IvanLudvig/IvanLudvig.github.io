Mount Etna is the highest and most active volcano in Europe. The night before I came to Sicily, Etna erupted and I was hyped up to see the action. Lava fountains of 500m sounded sick.

I'm not sure if for good or for bad, but the eruptions didn't occur during my 3 day stay in Sicily. At that time I had trouble reconciling with the environment and naturally I thought of climbing Etna. And on my 3rd day in Sicily, when the weather was the best, I did. 

There's just one bus a day to the foothills of Etna, leaving from the square in front of the train station of Catania. A return ticket costs â‚¬6,60. On the way to Etna it luckily stopped in a town, where I stocked up. The bus arrives at Rifugio Sapienza, which is at 2000m (Etna's peak is 3357m).

After getting higher than the clouds, the proper path almost disappeared and was covered in snow.

Having regular shoes didn't help. I was thinking of how I was going to get down afterwards.

After reaching 2500m, we discovered that there is actually a proper road, where big trucks drive.

Despite the fact that it's prohibited to go beyond the 2500m mark without a guide, we continued our ascent. The peak was luring.

It became colder and colder the higher we went.

The highest we reached was about 2800m, where the path ends.

The way down was amazing. From 2500m we took another _proper_ road, which was longer.

The snow beautifully contrasted with the black rocks.

Gradually the snow disappeared.

On the way down we inspected other craters.

I enjoyed the hike a lot and it definitely helped me reconcile with the environment. It was the highest point I've ever been to.
