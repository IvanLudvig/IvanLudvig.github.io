In the square by the castle stands "Venus of the Rags". The first time it was installed, it was burned down within two weeks. Now it has a constant admirer and protector: the security guard. They enjoy each other's company.

In fact, not just the sculpture, but the whole city faces a risk of being turned into ashes.

No, these are mere admirers. No mortal was willing to take such a great responsibility. Instead, Naples finds its guardians in the seaside shrines scattered among the rocks. If you listen closely to the sound of the waves, you can pick out the prayers they whisper.
