Although I've heard a lot of bad things about Paris, I found it absolutely wonderful. The streets are charming.

Now, to the main landmarks.

I went up to the second floor of the Eiffel tower by stairs, spotted the iconic San Coeur Basilica on the Montmartre hill and noticed how fabulous the modernist Russian Orthodox Cathedral is.

I visited the Louvre. Although I've heard this point before, but the Mona Lisa was still smaller than I expected.

After the Louvre, I visited a more artsy museum.

I met an English girl there who said that Paris is similar to London, but more stylish and Gothic. I believe her.

On another day, I headed to the chinatown.

The chinatown is a proper one, looks just like China.

There's a buddhist temple in an underground parking lot. You won't find it even on atlas obscura.

I've used mostly bikes to travel around the city, but sometimes I took the metro.

The fruit stall in front of the turnstiles is a brilliant idea.

There is not much variety in the metro. It's not pretty, but stylish.

I encountered an interesting metro exit: on the left is Maxim Gorky Boulevard, and on the right is Stalingrad Avenue.

Montmartre is very crowded.

On my final night I went to an IC3PEAK concert. Actually, I planned the dates of this trip in order to visit it. It was energetic, fun and orthodox. I was surprised how many French people knew about the band and came there.

At the concert I met a person who had the same name as my sister, which had never happened before (it's not a very common French name). We drank a lot of red wine and ate fried chicken after the event.

After three days in Paris, it's time to leave for Lyon. I officially transfer the worst bus station title to Paris from Milan, which received it from Novorossiysk. The entrance even requires big red arrows, because nobody would believe that _this_ is the entrance.
