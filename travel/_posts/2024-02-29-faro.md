Faro is the capital of the Algrave region. Most foreigners visiting this city probably have a flight to/from the Faro airport, including me.

The architecture seems different from [Lisbon](/travel/2024/lisbon){:target="_blank"}. Houses often have flat roofs and are covered with decorative tiles.

The city definitely doesn't have a polished or touristy vibe, unlike [Lagos](/travel/2024/lagos){:target="_blank"}.

The shopping centre has a great design, taking advantage of the warm weather all year round. Interestingly, [windcatchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windcatcher){:target="_blank"} are beautifully incorporated into the design, which are usually seen in North Africa and the Middle East.

I liked this apartment building covered in graffiti.

By the way, they have soup at McDonald's in Portugal.

I had the feeling that something awaits me in Faro. All those quaint houses looked like they are keeping a secret. Something ominous. It's here. You go inside the church...
<center>
    <img src="/assets/img/faro/13.jpg" />
    <p class="image-label">Igreja do Carmo</p>
</center>
Then walk through a garden...

And find a chapel built out of bones. It is not just decorated, but made out of the bones of over 1,000 monks.
<center>
    <img src="/assets/img/faro/12.jpg" />
    <p class="image-label">Capela de Ossos</p>
</center>
The chapel has a haunting symmetry, derived in the most direct way from the inherent beauty and symmetry of humans. Honestly, I didn't think much about the chapel when looking it up online, but the visit shook me. I found myself face to face with mortality.

If it had been cold, I would've said it's bone-chilling, but it was warm.

Anyway, while visiting Faro I stayed on Praia de Faro (Faro Beach), which is a long barrier island.

In order to travel to and from the city, I took a ferry. The ride takes 25 minutes. In March there were 6 ferries a day. It costs €2.30 one way or €3.90 return.

The island is a long beach. The beach was mostly empty. In other words, it was all mine.

I spotted a German.

Apparently there are chameleons, but I didn't see any.

The island is very thin. It has one dusty road. Many restaraunts were closed during my visit and the island has one little corner store. So I made sure to bring food from the city. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the isolated location. Moreover, the hostel was very cheap for Portugal (€10/night).

Another good thing about Praia de Faro is that Faro airport is nearby. I walked there in the morning of my last day, contemplating my trip.

My itinerary, which was planned day by day after leaving Lisbon, was balanced and comprehensive. Looking back at the ocean, it all made sense. I first felt my pulse  in Cascais in [Boca do Inferno](/travel/2024/cascais#boca-do-inferno){:target="_blank"}. Hiking [Rota Vicentina](/travel/2024/rota-vicentina){:target="_blank"} was my journey of life. [Lagos](/travel/2024/lagos){:target="_blank"} was a lonely place for reflection and search for meaning. In Faro I confronted death at the Bone Chapel, and Praia de Faro was heaven.

Overall, I really enjoyed my 8-day trip. I would put Portugal in my top 3 visited countries and surely come again to check out the Northern part.
